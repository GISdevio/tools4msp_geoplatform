    The design, development and implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/CNR-ISMAR/tools4msp">Tools4MSP</a>
    modelling framework together with the maintenance and update of the Tools4MSP Geoplatform is coordinated
    by the Tools4MSP Team. The Team is part of the CNR-ISMAR ( <a href="http://www.ismar.cnr.it/">Italian National Research Council - Institute of Marine Sciences</a> ), Office of Venice. Currently, our research activities focus on the analysis of cumulative effects from human activities, trade-off-synergies analysis of multiple sea uses, ecosystem-based approach, integration of ecosystem services into MSP and development of open source tools to support MSP and ICZM.

        Commission with her project MEDIX “Marine Environmental DynamIcs and seX-based analysis for climate change adaptation in marine spatial planning” (2020-2023). Her research focuses on understanding and modelling the responses to climate change of marine life at multiple levels of biological diversity, to incorporate this knowledge in marine management and CC adaptation and mitigation. She has over a decade of research experience in producing and integrating ecological knowledge and insights in decision making processes. She has applied her findings in marine spatial planning, and also in environmental and energy planning. She was Assistant Professor at the University Iuav of Venice, where she coordinated the local research units in many research projects (e.g., ADRIPLAN, SUPREME, SIMWESTMED). Among others, she designed and coordinated the Interreg Europe Project IRENES “Integrating RENewable energy and Ecosystem Services in environmental and energy policies”, and the Erasmus Mundus Master Course on Maritime Spatial Planning. She holds the Italian National Habilitations as Associate Professor in Ecology and Spatial Planning.
