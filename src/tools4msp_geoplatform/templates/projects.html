Results of research activities will be directly linked to the ongoing implementation processes of International, European and National policies on the sea (in particular the Maritime Spatial Plans), in close connection with competent administrations, stakeholders and local communities. It will promote the development and application of approaches and enabling technologies (e.g. integration of observations, data, models and support tools) in the planning, monitoring and adaptation phases of MSP and provide operational answers and demonstrations to specific knowledge demands at local or sectoral scale, through selected case studies. Finally, it will design and build the conditions to establish a stable infrastructure of knowledge and related services on the subject of MSP, biodiversity and sustainable blue economy.

                  The European Green Deal (EGD) is an ambitious package of policy initiatives to set the EU on the path to a green transition, improving the well-being and health of citizens and future generations. MSP-GREEN recognises that EGD components within MSP plans are still limited and must be reinforced and operationalised. The project aims at developing a framework to analyse and strengthen the role of MSP plans as “marine enablers” of the EGD, focusing on the topics

MSP-GREEN approach builds on three major components: analysis, innovation (via valuable practises and new actions), and transferability. Recommendations on how to strengthen the EGD ambition of EU MSP plans and boost EGD implementation with actions addressed by MSP will be prepared based on the project results and by consulting experts and practitioners at EU level. CNR-ISMAR contributes to several project activities and will lead WP4 “Towards a Greener MSP for Europe: scaling-up and innovating” aiming at defining the recommendations to make MSP an enabler of the EGD.

The management relies on improved systemic biodiversity prioritization criteria for MPAs and EBSAs, based on the best available scientific knowledge on biodiversity attributes, and linking spatial ecological features (including migratory ones) with socio-economic considerations. MSP4BIO uses a participatory approach to co-develop ecosystem services tradeoff scenarios to prioritize the areas and assess the suitability of spatial and strategic management measures from the ecological and socioeconomic perspectives. The approach integrates the criteria and objectives of relevant maritime and biodiversity policies as well as the EUBS 2030 to ensure coherent policy implementation. As such, the project will develop and improve approaches, methods, and tools to feed scientific knowledge, making it of direct use to planners and MPA managers, while producing site-specific results informing site-specific, and broader policy processes and decisions. The project builds on and integrate existing knowledge and results from multiple origins, and ensures effective collaboration with relevant projects and initiatives to fill present gaps on marine biodiversity, speeding up the scientific brake while paving pave the way for effective biodiversity management.

                        This is an area of high ecological importance, hosting valuable benthic communities (such as deep-sea corals and deep-sea sponge aggregations) and important habitats for Mediterranean megafauna species. The study mapped the distribution of maritime activities occurring in the area as well as of key ecological components (habitats and species), to then identify major pressures exerted by the firsts on the seconds. Tools4MSP CEA, a Python-based Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for geospatial analysis in support of Maritime Spatial Planning and marine environmental management, was used to assess the cumulative impact of maritime activities and relate pressures on selected species and benthic habitat and identify priority areas of concern for conservation. Eventually, the study delivered three narrative scenarios about the possible future development of marine protection and maritime sectors in the SAIS-EBSA: “Business As Usual”, “Sustainable Blue Economy” and “Nature Protection” scenarios.
