# Groups

The routines in this directory handle groups download and upload.

## Reports and data

Download and upload reports are saved in the `/data/groups` directory:

- `/download` contains the cover images of the groups
- `/download-report` contains reports of the download processes
- `/data.json` contains the downloaded data
- `/download-state.json` marks all the groups already downloaded so that multiple download processes skip them
- `/creation-report` contains reports of the upload processes
- `/creation-state.json` marks all the groups already uploaded so that multiple upload processes skip them
